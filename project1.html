<h2>Project 1 Questions</h2>
<div class="rows">
  <div class="column">
<h1>Question 1</h1>
<p>Search engines work by gathering information with the use of “crawlers”. Those “spiders”, search the internet and find websites. Keywords from the code of these websites are compiled so that the websites can be recalled with the use of a search query. The results then are organized by relevance, then by popularity. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
<h1>Question 2</h1>
<p>Keywords and descriptions as meta tags are essential to keep websites searchable. Even though we can see an image and describe what we see, a search engine cannot. The keywords keep the site from mixing contextual signals as well. Canadian bacon and ham could easily be misconstrued by a search engine. Also, keywords keep the website relevant. Aligning your metatag with keywords that are popular in the subject that you have on your website will also help generate views. </p>
</div>

  <div class="column">
<h1>Question 3</h1>
<p>Four elements that comprise writing relevant content links are linking content that is relevant to your site, contains credible, trustworthy content, avoid earning links from sources that don’t match your page’s topic, and being a healthy mix of follow and nofollow. These methods keep the content based around a central topic. It makes the page more valuable by being credible. It keeps the link organized and not excessive. </p>
  </div>


  <div class="column">
<h1>Question 4</h1>

<p>A good heading hierarchy starts with h1 and goes up to h6. The order should be largest to smallest and paragraph, if necessary, following the heading tag. To lead into the document, start with the document type declaration, followed by html, and lastly whichever attribute you would like to define first. Some examples of good heading hierarchy are as follows
<h2>!DOCTYPE html</h2>
<h2>html</h2>
<h2>body</h2>
<p>Another that specifies to search engine the language is:</p>
<h2>!DOCTYPE html</h2>
<h2>html lang="en"</h2>
<h2>body</h2>
